Even in purely practical terms, the best place to start when looking to increase your sales is simply to review the strategies and tactics that you are deploying right now and looking to make improvements.  But, before starting, be sure you understand what marketing really is...

> <span class="teaser">Marketing is simply your ability to influence people to buy your product or service.</span><cite>[Steve Hackney, The Core Asset][3]</cite>

Steve Hackney has identified that successful marketing strategies contain each of the 9 core elements listed below.  In short, if you check that each of your current marketing initiatives has all of these elements, then you can be sure they are at their optimum effectiveness.  It is that simple.
So what are these core elements?

## The Core Elements

The Core Elements consist of 5 Marketing components and 4 Sales components.  In simple terms, if each marketing piece you deploy has all of these elements in place, it will have the best chance of performing to its maximum level of effectiveness.

#### The Marketing Elements are as follows...

#### The Target Market
<p>The target market is a clearly identifiable group that can be identified as: needing your product or service; can afford to buy; can be defined discretely; can be reached with your marketing efforts</p>
#### The Differentiator
<p>A differentiator is something that sets your products or services apart from your competitors and by extension, your company from your competitors.  This appears to be a straightforward element to define, but it is not always as clear as you may think.</p>
#### An Irresistible Offer
<p>This will be something that the target market will find very difficult to ignore.</p>
#### The Guarantee
<p>Allowing your customers to buy with confidence is crucial. Offering a guarantee simply removes the risk from the buyer.</p>
#### Social Proof
<p>Showing the prospects how existing customers have benefitted from your product or service also builds confidence in your product or service.</p>

#### The Sales Elements are as follows...
#### The Headline
<p>A Punchy eye grabbing headline will capture the attention of the prospect. You have only fractions of a second to entice them to read more.</p>
#### Features & Benefits
<p>Outlining the features of your product or service alone is not enough to engage your audience.  You need to spell out how each feature will result in a specific benefit for your target market.</p>
#### Reasons Why
<p>Ask yourself why should the prospect buy from you?  It is the exact question they really will be asking themselves.  Having a unique product would be excellent, but there are probably alternatives to be considered, so spell out why they should buy from you.</p>
#### Call to Action
<p>Often overlooked, but it is crucial to guide your prospective customer through your sales process.  The actions they should take next and remember to outline what they can expect to happen after that.  It is also a good time to remind them of your offer and any other reason why they should take the action without delay.</p>
