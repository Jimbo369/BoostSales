## What is Customer Value?

There are a number of ways to answer this question.  Once you gain a customer, it represents an intrinsic cost - in simple terms, a portion of the marketing money you spent to acquire him or her.  Using our techniques and expertise, you will acquire more customers per unit spend on marketing. The value to you of each customer will be whatever they spend with you less the acquisition cost. Provided that each customer is profitable, then all will be well!<br>
This section is concerned with maximising the value that each customer represents.
## How do we Maximise Customer Value?

The first thing to note - which is of paramount importance - is that the value proposition works both ways.  As described above, you will be able to derive a monetary amount that represents the customer, but that customer needs to be able to do his own calculation that proves his business benefits by more that price paid to you for your product or service.<br>

Assuming this is the case then in this section, we focus on increasing value across 4 key areas.
<ul>
<li><b>Increasing the frequency of purchase</b></li> Getting the current customers to buy more often.
<li><b>Increasing the number of referrals</b></li> Getting more recommendations from customers - warm leads
<li><b>Increasing the average order value</b></li> Getting the customer to buy more every sale
<li><b>Reducing the level of attrition</b></li> Keeping the customers for a longer time
</ul>
