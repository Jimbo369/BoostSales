## Systemise and Automate - what does it really mean?

One of the many challenges of running a small business is that there are never enough people to do all of the jobs that need to be done.  Initially, the business owner does everything and as it grows the opportunities to take on more people appear.  As you well know, this is a chicken and egg situation - you need to grow to afford the cost to take on new people but you also need new people on board to grow!<br>
This conundrum aside, when you do bring on new people, they need to be trained to perform their job.  The only effective way to do this is to document each and every aspect of the particular role in such a way as to allow anyone to read that documentation and be able to perform the role straightaway and ideally without too much interaction from you.  Operating in this way encourages a standardised way of working and so a predictable result - crucially it also reduces mistakes - which is a key component to ensure ongoing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

It is exactly the same with your marketing and sales processes. So, for example, documenting what should happen when a lead comes to you through each passible source.  This is an interesting exercise in workflow as there will be many decision points: 'if the lead is from the website, take action A then B if another condition is satisfied then take Action C otherwise action D and so on'. It is surprising how complex some of the simplest operations can be because of the number of decision branches they could follow.<br>
One of the useful consequences of performing this action is that you will be able to see quite clearly those portions of the process that would lend themselves to be automated.  In some cases it may be possible to automate a whole section - an example may be an email chain.  Other areas - lika actually talking to the prospect...clearly not!
