## The Science of Marketing

Sales and marketing activities are undertaken everyday by thousands of people.  Most if not all will have a well developed instinct for what needs to be done next in the sales process and yet the majority could not accurately document the entire process.

One person who has is Steve Hackney.  He has brought it all together and thoroughly tested every aspect over a period of more than 20 years and the result is what he has called: The Formula.

The Formula is a simple to understand definition that explains exactly how marketing works.  

> <span class="teaser">This is the science of marketing. The Marketing DNA.  The core elements are based on the results over the last two decades and they are the foundation of all SUCCESSFUL sales and marketing.</span><cite>[Steve Hackney, The Core Asset][3]</cite>

Steve has developed an array of tools and strategies that enable any business to apply these marketing principles logically and efficiently to develop more sales.  We empower you to utilise these tools by defining a bespoke roadmap to meet your needs; then coaching you to apply the tools through your own secure Core Asset Vault. We are delighted to have incorporated this significant toolset within our Sales Improvement Programme.

## The Formula
This is really a very simple yet clever representation of the way in which marketing works and illustrates the areas that you can focus on to make the improvements you desire.  It also shows how these components relate to each other and the effect that you can expect from the improvements you make.
### T - Transform Existing Marketing
Check that all of you current strategies have the core elements embedded and so, are operating at their optimum level.
### L - Lead generation
Examine the ways in which your sales leads are generated and add more methods to increase the number of leads entering the sales funnel.
### C - Sales Lead Conversion
The number of leads you need to produce a sale is your Lead Conversion Ratio. This is an average - so if you produce 100 sales leads every month and make 10 sales, the ratio is 100:10 = 10:1 or 10%.
There are many factors involved in the conversion of leads to sales....The Sales Process to most people.  However, there are lots of things that can be done to improve this Ratio and importantly, to ensure that it is repeatable each and every period.
### M - Maximising Customer Value
This may sound like it is a callous way to fleece the customer, but nothing could be further from the truth! The Value of each customer to your business is the profitability of each customer.  Are you maximising the value derived from each of your customers?  Typically, a customer is engaged with a supplier because they are looking for a particular item or a particular solution to a specific problem.  It is almost universally the case that the same customer will have a different requirement that your business can fulfil.  The larger the customer, the more likely this is to be the case.  Even if your business only sells drawing pins and the customer needs desks - you should be able and willing to provide a solution to that need.  You need to expand your thinking to include more propositions that will add to the value <em>YOU</em> can provide to the customer.  
### S - Systemisation and Automation
Once you have been through each of these stages and made your improvements - actually, whilst you make the improvements you should be looking at ways to standardise the way in which each of the processes is implemented. Why? Simply to make each process repeatable - and so to consolidate the results and so make them repeatable too.  Automating many aspects of these processes is becoming easier as technology develops and becomes cheaper to use.  This is particular important because it means the tedious tasks can get done by machine making more time available for the complex and more interesting tasks.

## Results
This is the only thing that counts - the <em>RESULTS</em> that you get from implementing The Formula.
To illustrate how important this work is, consider the following:

Imagine that you are able to improve just the first three areas by 20% just by tweaking what you do now.  
> <span class="teaser">So - generate 20% more sales leads.  Close 20% more of these leads.  Increase the value from each customer by 20%.  You can see from the illustration below that a 20% increase in each of these areas delivers a massive 72.8% increase in the turnover figure!<br><br>
Now, imagine that you start to implement some of our strategies to each of these area and improve again by another 10%.  The turnover increases from £12,500 to £28,749 - that's an increase of almost 130%!!.</span>


| <b>Sales Improvement Illustration </b>
<b>Component</b> | <b>Current (monthly)</b> | <b>After 20% Improvement</b> | <b>More Tactics 10% Improvement</b>
Lead Generation | 100     | 120  | 132
Sales Conversion | 25% | 30%  | 33%
Customer Maximisation | £500 | £600 | £660
Total Turnover | £12,500 | £21,600   | £28,749

This is before we add in the final component, which is to systemise and automate which has the effect of multiplying all of these factors again!
