## The Sales Effort

When business owners think about developing their sales - this is usually what is in the forefront of their mind.  <br><strong>"I need more sales people or better sales people to close more deals!"</strong> Naturally, the skills of the sales person are extremely important and all of the various strategies associated with major account sales, new business development, etc should be deployed as you see fit to close the sales.  <br>
It is important though, to recognise where this activity sits in the overall process.  The business has already undertaken masses of work to get the infrastructure in place to inform prospective customers about its products and services and generating sales leads as a result.  So a great deal of expenditure has already occurred just to get sales leads into the sales funnel.<br>
It is therefore obvious that these leads need to be pursued in a timely manner and as efficiently as possible.  What does that mean exactly?<br>
Well, these prospects don't all behave in the same way, some are ready to buy immediately and some (I would say most) are not.  Usually, it is left to the sales person to manage this aspect.  Many customer relationship management systems have pipeline management tools to assist in this matter.  Allowing the sales person to assess the location of the prospect on his journey to becoming a customer.  This is a subjective assessment and sadly there is seldom enough structure around this particular activity to ensure it is robust and able to produce consistent results.<br>
<strong>This is where we can make a difference!</strong> We can show you what needs to be done to within your own particular business to move a higher proportion of your sales leads through to the point where they place their order with you!<br>
What would it mean for your business if we can increase Lead generation, Conversion and Customer value by 20% and then turbo charge the  conversion ratio by just another 10%?  Experience shows that there can be a much higher ratio can be achieved using our strategies and tactics. See what a difference it can make here:

| <b>Sales Improvement Illustration </b>
<b>Component</b> | <b>Current (monthly)</b> | <b>After overall 20% Improvement</b>|<b>After 10% additional tactics-Conversion Only</b> | <b>More Tactics 10% Improvement</b>
Lead Generation | 100     | 120  | 120|132
Sales Conversion | 25% | 30%  | 33%| 33%
Customer Maximisation | £500 | £600 | £600|£660
Total Turnover | £12,500 | £21,600   | £23,760| £28,750

This is equivalent to growing from an annual turnover of £150,000 to £345,000 and the good news is that many of the improvement tactics can be deployed relatively quickly meaning that those benefits can be accrued very quickly.
