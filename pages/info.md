    <p><h5>It is an interesting fact that most small business owners have started their business journey as experts or specialists at what they do. This is a key point outlined by Michael Gerber in his excellent and now updated book "The E Myth Revisited". He calls it, "The Entrepreneurial Seizure". The 'expert' is performing a technical role - making, designing, writing stuff etc. - they are performing a technical part of the business.  The Entrepreneurial Seizure occurs at the point when the employee realises that they could do the same work as they are doing now but for more rewards by working for themselves. Once the seizure happens, there is nothing for it but to start up on their own.  He continues to explain that, at the same time, the employee also makes the "Fatal Assumption" - '..if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand the business that does that technical work. And the reason it is fatal is that it just isn't true.'  We recommend our clients read this great book!</h5></p><br>

  <p><h5>One of the primary operational functions of any business is its Sales and Marketing operation.  Many small businesses owners by definition run their sales and marketing function.  If this is not an area of expertise for the owner, then it is unlikely to be working as effectively as it could. Similarly, as the company grows, the addition of the right sales and marketing people can be hit and miss.  Our aim is to engage with clients who identify with this situation and help them to transform  their sales and marketing into an effective operation and then on to being an efficient operation too.</h5></p>

  <p><h3>What's in a name? What does Superne Mean?</h3></p>
  <p><h5>This is actually a question that we are asked quite often. <strong>'Superne'</strong> - like many words in the English language - is derived from Latin.  It means 'to get  higher or better'.  Basically, to <em><b> improve </b></em>. </h5></p>
