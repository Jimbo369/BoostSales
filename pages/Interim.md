## What is Interim Management?
<h5>
<p>Have you found yourself in the situation where you just don't have the manpower to get everything done?</p>
<p>Customers or clients become dissatisfied because you just can't provide the level of service that they demand - or that they <em>used</em> to get!</p>

<p>This is a situation repeated up and down the country....not enough bodies - or perhaps bodies with the wrong attitude - leaving customers high and dry in some cases....and your profits are marooned with them!</p>

<p>The solution is right here.  Interim resources.  From senior sales and marketing team building and management to lead generation.  Whatever your need we can help you out.  We have an array of individuals with vast experience across all areas of the sales and marketing function that can be contracted to fill the gaps.</p>
</h5>

#### But how do you train them up so they know about your product or service?
<h5>
<p> It is true that this can be a tricky area, but we have found that actually a canny deployment of your resources usually results in the interim person requiring only rudimentary knowledge in this area.  The biggest source of irritation for most customers is that there is nobody available to even talk to.  YES- that's right....most people understand the challenges of reduced resources and are at a minimum placated initially because their concern or question has been received and processed.</p>
