### That's Right - Our Work is GUARANTEED!

<p>You may have engaged with consultants, mentors or business coaches in the past.  Typically there is a day rate charged - which in comparison to directly employing someone - is usually a very good option for temporary solutions.</p>
<br><br>
<p>However, there is always a niggling thought in the back of the mind - are you going to get your money's worth from this person?</p>
<br><br>
<p>This is something we have seen before - and perhaps you haven't considered the view from the consultant's standpoint.  What if I put a lot of time in and don't get paid - promptly or at all?</p>
<br><br>
### A Real Conundrum!
<br>
<p>We have the solution - something that you won't see everywhere - <strong>a Money-Back Guarantee!</strong></p>
<br><br>
<p>So how does this work?  Well, at the start of our engagement we will discuss what you need and come up with a proposal - that doesn't cost you anything.</p>
<br>
<p>For a Mentoring or Coaching engagement (billed at an hourly rate), we will be working with you to map out a series of tangible objectives and we will help you to define the actions needed to reach these objectives.  It will be your responsibility to implement these actions to get you to where you want the business to be.  Once the tangible objective is achieved, then we have completed that part of our job.  If you follow the recommended actions and do not reach the objective, then you will get your money back.
For example: completion of objectives A, B and C is to deliver a 10% increase in leads generated. If it does not, then you get your money back.<br><br>
For a Consulting Engagement (billed at a day rate), we will be working with you to map out a series of tangible objectives and the associated actions needed to meet them.  We will be completing the action items - some of which will need to be actually implemented by you.  Provided that you do as we instruct, the guarantee will still apply.  However, in this scenario, we will also agree with you a SUCCESS FEE based upon the increase in your profitability due to our efforts - giving us "Skin in the Game"!  </p>
