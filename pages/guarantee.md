      <h3 style="text-align:center"><u>That's Right - Our Work is <strong>GUARANTEED!</strong></u></h3>

      <h5>
      <p>You may have engaged with consultants, mentors or business coaches in the past.  Typically there is a day rate charged - which in comparison to directly employing someone - is usually a very good option for temporary solutions.</p>

      <p>However, there is always a niggling thought in the back of the mind - are you going to get your money's worth from this person?  Maybe you know someone who has worked with them before...but that is still not a guarantee.</p>

      <p>This is something we have seen before - and perhaps you haven't considered the view from the consultant's standpoint.  What if I put a lot of time in and don't get paid promptly - paid or at all? That is a risk too.</p>
      </h5>

      <h4 style="text-align:center"><u><b>A Real Conundrum!</b></u></h4>

      <h5>
        <p>We <b>DO</b> have a <u>solution</u> to this conundrum - something that you won't see everywhere......</p>
      </h5>
      <h3 style="text-align:center"><strong><u>Our Money-Back Guarantee!</u></strong></h3>

      <h5>
        <p>So how does this work?  Right at the start - just prior to our engagement we will discuss what you need.  This activity doesn't cost you anything other than some of your time.  We will define the work that needs to be undertaken and we will issue a proposal based on two scenarios.</p>

        <p>The first scenario is a Mentoring or Coaching engagement which is billed at an hourly rate. In essence, we will be working with you to map out a series of tangible objectives and we will help you to define the actions needed to reach these objectives.  This is our <b>ROADMAP</b> activity.</p>

        <p>We provide access to all of the tools you will need to follow your <b>ROADMAP</b> and coach or mentor you through the process every month. It will be your responsibility to implement these actions to get you to where you want the business to be step by step.  This has the advantage that you to gain full understanding of the sales and marketing processes that need to be adopted to increase your sales.</p>

        <p>Once the tangible objective is achieved, then we have completed that part of our job.  If you follow the recommended actions and do not reach the objective, then you will get your money back for that period.</p>

        <p>The second scenario starts in the same way in terms of defining the work that is required.  However, it would then be our responsibility to create the strategies called for by the <b>ROADMAP</b> on your behalf which you would then implement in your organisation. We refer to this as a Consulting Engagement, which is billed at a day rate that will be lower pro rata than the hourly rate.  However, in this scenario, we will also agree with you a <strong>SUCCESS FEE</strong> based upon the expected increase in your profitability due to our efforts - giving us <em><strong>"Skin in the Game"!</strong></em> </p>

        <p>The purpose of this is to ensure we complete the activities as quickly as possible and so deliver your results as quickly as possible and as maximised as possible so that we earn the success fee as quickly as possible!  <strong>WIN-WIN!!!</strong></p>

        <p>What does this guarantee do for you?  Well, it is designed to give you</p>
      </h5>
      <h4 style="text-align:center"><b>PEACE OF MIND!!</b></h4><br>
