<h5>Sales and marketing activities are undertaken everyday by thousands of people.  Most if not all will have a well developed instinct for what needs to be done next in the sales process and yet the majority could not accurately document the entire process.

  One person who has is Steve Hackney.  He has brought it all together and thoroughly tested every aspect over a period of more than 20 years and the result is a product set he has developed called The Formula.  We are delighted to have incorporated this as the basis for our Sales Improvement Programme.</h5>

It is the culmination of over 20 years of work by Steve Hackney of The Core Asset, and it proves that marketing activities can be constructed and deployed in a logical and methodical way which will guarantee that sales will be increased.  It is a scientific revelation!</h5><br>
