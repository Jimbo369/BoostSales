### ...is all about generating more Leads, Increasing Lead Conversion thereby Boosting Sales.
<p>Sales and marketing activities are undertaken everyday by thousands of people.  Most if not all will have a well developed instinct for what needs to be done next in the sales process and yet the majority could not accurately document the entire process in a succinct and comprehensive form.</p>

<p>One person who has managed to do just that is Steve Hackney.  He has brought it all together and thoroughly tested every aspect over a period of more than 20 years and the result is a product set he has developed called <strong>The FORMULA</strong>.  We are delighted to have incorporated this as the basis for our Sales Improvement Programme.</p>

As mentioned, it is the culmination of over 20 years of work by Steve Hackney of The Core Asset, and it proves that marketing activities can be constructed and deployed in a logical and methodical way which will guarantee that sales will be increased.  It is a scientific revelation!</p>
